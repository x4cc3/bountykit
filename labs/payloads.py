I discovered a reflected XSS vulnerability on the login page of hackerone.com.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to https://hackerone.com/users/sign_in
2. Enter the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` in the email field
3. Submit the form
4. Observe the JavaScript alert with session cookies

## Impact
An attacker could steal session cookies and perform account takeover on any HackerOne user. The XSS executes in the context of the authenticated user's session.
